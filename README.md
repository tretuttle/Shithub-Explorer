> Ever wanted to search for more than a single topic at one time? Tired of not being able to find the right repo you found one night while doom scrolling at 3:00am? Wondering why you can't find something amongst the billion of accounts each big company has? **Shithub Explorer** is here for you. 🕵️‍♂️

## 🎯 What This Thing Actually Does

Let's be real - GitHub's search is... *fine*... but sometimes you need to dig deeper than what their basic search can handle. This little webapp helps you:

- 🔍 **Multi-Topic Search**: Because searching one topic at a time is for rookies
- 🏢 **Organization Detective**: Find all those sneaky subsidiary accounts big companies hide their repos in
- 🧭 **Repository Deep Dive**: Get the juicy details on any repo without clicking through 47 different tabs
- 🌙 **3AM Doom Scroll Mode**: Dark theme included because we know when you'll actually use this

## 🚀 Try It Out (The Fun Part)

Stop reading and start clicking: **[https://tretuttle.github.io/shithub-explorer/](https://tretuttle.github.io/shithub-explorer/)**

## 🤷‍♂️ Why Does This Exist?

Because sometimes at 2:47 AM you remember seeing this *perfect* repository that would solve all your problems, but you can only remember it had something to do with "machine learning" and "cats" and maybe it was from Google? Or was it Facebook? Or one of their 47 subsidiary organizations?

Yeah, we've all been there. 😅

## 🎨 Screenshots? Maybe Later

Look, it's a web app. It has buttons. You click them. Things happen. Revolutionary stuff, really.
